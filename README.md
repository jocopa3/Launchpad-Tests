#Info
I used [rngtng's Launchpad library](https://github.com/rngtng/launchpad) because I was too lazy to write my own. I may write my own in the future to remove that dependency, but for now it's staying! I also chose to use the source of rngtng's Launchpad library and its required thedmidibus dependency for quick and easy modifications.

#Quick Tip:
The folder named "macropad" includes source for a soon to exist GUI macro editor for the Launchpad; currently all it does is change button colors, but eventually you'll be able to assign actions and colors to each button using it.

[HelperPad.java](https://github.com/jocopa3/Launchpad-Tests/blob/master/src/launchpad/HelperPad.java) includes the more interesting stuff, such as assigning macros and colors to buttons for easy access.
